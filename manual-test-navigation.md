# Manual Test: Navigation Bug Fix

## Test: Automatic Redirection When Location is Lobby but User is on Game Page

This test verifies that users are automatically redirected from game pages to the lobby when their location state is "lobby".

### Prerequisites
1. Start the development servers: `npm run dev`
2. Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`

### Test Steps

#### Method 1: Using Browser Console
1. Navigate to a game page: `http://localhost:3000/game/1`
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Check current location state:
   ```javascript
   window.socketService.getCurrentUserLocation()
   // Should return "lobby" by default
   ```

4. Since location is already "lobby" but you're on game page, the automatic navigation should trigger
5. You should be automatically redirected to the lobby (`/`)

#### Method 2: Simulating Location Change
1. Go to lobby page: `http://localhost:3000/`
2. Join a table as observer to change location to "table-X"
3. Navigate directly to a different game page: `http://localhost:3000/game/2`
4. In console, simulate location change back to lobby:
   ```javascript
   window.socketService.handleLocationUpdate({
     playerId: window.socketService.getSocket().id,
     nickname: 'TestUser',
     location: 'lobby'
   })
   ```
5. You should be automatically redirected to lobby within seconds

### Expected Results
- âœ… **Before Fix**: User would stay on game page despite location being "lobby" (logs would show location but no navigation)
- âœ… **After Fix**: User is automatically redirected to lobby when location is "lobby" but on game page

### Console Output to Look For
```
ðŸŽ¯ FRONTEND: Current user location updated to: lobby
ðŸŽ¯ FRONTEND: Current user (TestUser) is now at: Lobby (browsing tables)
ðŸš€ FRONTEND: Location is lobby but not on lobby page, redirecting...
ðŸš€ FRONTEND: Current path: /game/1
ðŸš€ NAVIGATION: Navigating to / (replace: true)
```

### Verification
- User should end up on lobby page (`/`)
- URL should be `http://localhost:3000/`
- Console should show navigation messages
- No errors in console

## Additional Test Cases

### Test: Correct Game Page Navigation
1. Simulate location change to a table:
   ```javascript
   window.socketService.handleLocationUpdate({
     playerId: window.socketService.getSocket().id,
     nickname: 'TestUser',
     location: 'table-5'
   })
   ```
2. Should navigate to `/game/5` if not already there

### Test: No Unnecessary Navigation
1. Go to lobby page
2. Ensure location is "lobby"
3. Should NOT trigger any navigation (already on correct page)

## Bug Fix Summary
- **Issue**: Frontend correctly tracked location as "lobby" but didn't automatically navigate
- **Root Cause**: `handleLocationBasedNavigation` only logged but didn't perform actual navigation
- **Solution**: Created `navigationService` for programmatic navigation from socketService
- **Result**: Automatic redirection now works when location/page mismatch is detected
