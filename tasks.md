## Test Failures

1. **Server Port Configuration**
   - Cypress tests failing because server not running on port 3001
   - Need to ensure backend runs on port 3001 and frontend on port 3000
   - Update server configuration to handle port conflicts gracefully
   - Backend server must be started before running E2E tests
   - Add script to start both servers for E2E testing

2. **Text Matching Issues**
   - Errors like `Unable to find an element with the text: Players (2)` or `Players (0)`.
   - This is likely because the text is split across multiple elements (e.g., "Players", "(", "2", ")").
   - Use a custom matcher function for `getByText` or regex with `getByText` (e.g., `/Players\s*\(2\)/`).

3. **TableGrid Test: Socket Mock Issues**
   - Errors like `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '1')` when accessing `[1]` on the result of `.find(...)`.
   - This means the mock for `socket.on` is not set up to record calls as expected.
   - Ensure your socket mock is correctly set up and that the test is not relying on real socket connections.
