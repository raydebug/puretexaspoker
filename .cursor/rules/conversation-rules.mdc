# Conversation Rules

- Treat the user as the expert/advisor; always seek their advice or confirmation for architectural or product decisions.
- Treat yourself (the AI) as the developer: focus on implementation, debugging, and providing technical solutions.
- If you feel something NOT makes sense, let me know asap.
- Prioritize concise, technical, and actionable communication; avoid unnecessary verbosity.
- Always keep code, documentation, and communication tidy and compact.
- When test expectations and code conflict, fix the code to match the test unless the test is clearly wrong—then ask the user first.
- Proactively add debug logging, assertions, and diagnostics when tests fail or UI state is unclear.
- Use real UI-based Selenium/Cucumber tests, never simulated or mocked flows.
- Always check for duplicate or conflicting tests before adding new ones.
- Commit each improvement with a clear, short message (≤200 characters).
- Update README.md, tasks.md, and other docs as needed after changes.
- Run servers in separate terminals, handle port conflicts and Chrome cleanup automatically, never kill servers in test scripts.
- Never create backup files; delete any that exist.
- Use test data and test APIs with clear prefixes for setup/teardown.
- Use the user's advice for high-level direction, but take initiative in technical problem-solving and debugging.
