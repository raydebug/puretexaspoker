# Table-Only Architecture

- All backend and frontend logic must use the table and tableId as the core entity for poker state, seating, and actions.
- Eliminate all references to game, gameId, game state, and game-related events, APIs, and models.
- Refactor all logic to operate solely on table and tableId.
- All WebSocket and API events must use tableId (UUID string) as the identifier.
- Tests, test data, and Selenium/Cucumber step definitions must use only table/tableId.
