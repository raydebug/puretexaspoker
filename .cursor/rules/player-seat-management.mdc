# Player and Seat Management

- Player records in the database must use UUIDs as primary keys.
- PlayerTable associations must reference playerId and tableId as UUID strings.
- The backend must prevent duplicate seat assignments and handle "already seated" as a success.
- The frontend must not attempt to take a seat multiple times for the same player/table.
