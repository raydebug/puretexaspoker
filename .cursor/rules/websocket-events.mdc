# WebSocket Event Naming and Flow

- The backend emits 'authenticated', 'tableJoined', and 'seatTaken' events.
- The frontend must listen for these exact event names.
- The frontend must emit 'authenticate', 'joinTable', and 'takeSeat' events with the correct payloads.
- All event payloads must use string UUIDs for tableId and playerId.
- The frontend must handle 'alreadySeated' as a success case for seat assignment.
