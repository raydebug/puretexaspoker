# Test Data and UI-Only Testing

- Restart servers parallelly in different terminal in ide code area
- Do not kill servers in test scripts.
- Kill all running Chrome instances before starting UI tests.
- All test data setup must use UI flows or dedicated test APIs with proper prefixes.
- No backend-only or simulated/mocked mode is allowed for UI-based BDD Cucumber tests.
- Always check to avoid duplicate or conflicting tests.
- Use actual tableId from the API, not hardcoded values.
