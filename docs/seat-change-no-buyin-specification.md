# Seat Change Without Additional Buy-in Specification

## Overview
When a player is already seated at a poker table and wants to change to a different available seat, they should be able to do so without having to specify a new buy-in amount. Their existing chip stack should be preserved and transferred to the new seat.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### FR-1: Chip Stack Preservation
- **Requirement**: When a player changes seats, their chip stack must remain exactly the same
- **Details**: 
  - If a player has 750 chips at seat 2 and moves to seat 5, they should have exactly 750 chips at seat 5
  - No chips should be added or removed during the seat change process
  - The chip amount should be preserved regardless of the original buy-in amount

#### FR-2: No Additional Buy-in Required
- **Requirement**: Players should not be prompted for additional buy-in when changing seats
- **Details**:
  - The seat selection dialog should NOT contain a buy-in input field for existing players
  - The system should automatically use the player's current chip stack
  - No additional funds should be deducted from the player's account

#### FR-3: Seat Availability and Cleanup
- **Requirement**: Seat changes should properly update seat availability
- **Details**:
  - The player's original seat should become immediately available after the change
  - The target seat should become occupied by the player
  - Only one seat should be occupied by the player at any time during the process

#### FR-4: Multiple Seat Changes
- **Requirement**: Players should be able to change seats multiple times
- **Details**:
  - Each subsequent seat change should preserve the current chip amount
  - No accumulative buy-in requirements should apply
  - The chip amount should remain consistent across multiple changes

### User Interface Requirements

#### UI-1: Simplified Seat Change Dialog
- **Requirement**: The seat change dialog should be streamlined for existing players
- **Details**:
  - Should NOT display buy-in input fields
  - Should optionally display current chip amount for confirmation
  - Should have an immediately available "Confirm" button
  - Should clearly indicate this is a seat change, not a new buy-in

#### UI-2: Real-time Updates
- **Requirement**: The UI should update in real-time during seat changes
- **Details**:
  - Chip amount should remain visible and consistent throughout the process
  - Seat availability should update immediately
  - Other players should see the seat change reflected in real-time

### Backend Requirements

#### BE-1: Seat Change Logic
- **Requirement**: Backend should distinguish between new seat assignments and seat changes
- **Details**:
  - For new players: Require buy-in amount
  - For existing players changing seats: Use current chip stack
  - Maintain referential integrity in the database
  - Handle seat transitions atomically

#### BE-2: Data Consistency
- **Requirement**: Ensure data consistency during seat changes
- **Details**:
  - Player should be removed from old seat before being added to new seat
  - Chip amounts should be transferred accurately
  - No temporary states where player appears in multiple seats
  - Handle concurrent seat change requests appropriately

### Business Rules

#### BR-1: Seat Change Eligibility
- **Players can change seats if:**
  - They are currently seated at the table
  - The target seat is available
  - The game phase allows seat changes (typically not during active hands)
  - They have not exceeded any seat change limits (if implemented)

#### BR-2: Prohibited Seat Changes
- **Players cannot change seats if:**
  - They are currently involved in an active hand
  - The target seat is occupied
  - They are not currently seated at the table
  - The table has specific restrictions on seat changes

### Error Handling

#### EH-1: Invalid Seat Change Attempts
- **Requirement**: System should gracefully handle invalid seat change attempts
- **Details**:
  - Display clear error messages for occupied seats
  - Prevent seat changes during inappropriate game phases
  - Maintain player's current position if seat change fails

#### EH-2: Concurrent Seat Changes
- **Requirement**: Handle multiple players attempting to take the same seat
- **Details**:
  - Use proper locking mechanisms to prevent race conditions
  - First successful request wins
  - Provide appropriate feedback to unsuccessful attempts

### Testing Requirements

#### Test Cases Required:
1. **Basic Seat Change**: Player changes from one seat to another with chip preservation
2. **Multiple Seat Changes**: Player changes seats multiple times maintaining chip stack
3. **Different Buy-in Amounts**: Players with different initial buy-ins maintain their amounts
4. **UI Behavior**: Verify no buy-in dialogs appear for seat changes
5. **Concurrent Changes**: Multiple players changing seats simultaneously
6. **Error Cases**: Attempts to take occupied seats, invalid seat numbers

### Acceptance Criteria

#### AC-1: Successful Seat Change
```gherkin
Given I am seated at seat 2 with 1000 chips
When I change to seat 5
Then I should be at seat 5 with 1000 chips
And seat 2 should be available
And no additional buy-in should be required
```

#### AC-2: No Buy-in Dialog for Seat Changes
```gherkin
Given I am seated at any seat with chips
When I click on an available seat
Then the seat selection dialog should appear
And the dialog should NOT contain a buy-in input field
And the confirm button should be immediately available
```

#### AC-3: Chip Stack Consistency
```gherkin
Given I have X chips at my current seat
When I change to any available seat
Then I should have exactly X chips at the new seat
And my total chip count should remain unchanged
```

### Implementation Notes

#### Frontend Considerations:
- Detect if user is already seated when opening seat selection dialog
- Conditionally render buy-in input based on user's current status
- Display current chip amount for confirmation

#### Backend Considerations:
- Implement seat change endpoint separate from initial seat taking
- Use database transactions to ensure atomicity
- Validate seat change eligibility before processing

#### WebSocket Updates:
- Broadcast seat availability changes to all clients
- Update player positions in real-time
- Ensure all clients see consistent seat states

This specification ensures that seat changes are seamless, user-friendly, and maintain the integrity of the poker game while preserving player chip stacks.
