## üìù Development Guidelines

**Code Quality Standards**:
- All poker logic must be server-side validated
- Betting calculations must be precise (no floating point errors)
- Game state changes must be atomic and recoverable
- All actions must be auditable for dispute resolution

**Testing Requirements**:
- Every poker rule must have corresponding test coverage
- All edge cases (all-in, side pots, ties) must be tested
- Performance testing for concurrent player actions
- Security testing for anti-cheat measures

**Documentation Standards**:
- API documentation for all game actions
- Rules documentation for poker compliance
- Deployment guides for production setup
- Player guides for game features

This work plan transforms the current functional prototype into a professional-grade Texas Hold'em poker platform that meets industry standards and provides the comprehensive gameplay experience outlined in `game.md`.
