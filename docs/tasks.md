# Pure Texas Poker - Task Status & Work Plan

Based on the comprehensive `game.md` specification, here is the prioritized work plan to align the current implementation with professional Texas Hold'em standards.

## 🔥 IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Next Sprint)

### ✅ JUST COMPLETED

#### Comprehensive Poker Actions Testing Framework ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Complete Test Coverage**: Created comprehensive-poker-actions.feature with 10 detailed scenarios
- **All Poker Actions**: Tests for bet, call, raise, fold, check, and professional allIn implementation
- **Advanced Scenarios**: Complex all-in scenarios with multiple side pot creation and distribution
- **Edge Cases**: All-in with insufficient chips, below-minimum raises, professional poker rule compliance
- **Step Definitions**: 50+ step implementations in comprehensive-poker-actions-steps.js
- **Enhanced Backend APIs**: test_force_showdown, test_update_game_config, enhanced test_player_action
- **Side Pot Management**: Complete side pot creation, eligibility, and distribution testing
- **Real-Time Testing**: WebSocket synchronization, UI updates, and observer mode verification
- **Professional Compliance**: All poker actions follow official Texas Hold'em rules and standards

#### Professional All-In Betting System ✅ **COMPLETED** 
- **Enhanced Betting Logic**: All placeBet(), raise(), and call() methods now handle all-in scenarios
- **Dedicated AllIn Method**: New allIn() method for clean all-in betting actions  
- **Professional Rules Compliance**: All-in allowed even with insufficient chips (creates side pots)
- **All-in Raises**: Permitted below minimum raise requirement per poker rules
- **Full API Integration**: WebSocket (game:allIn) and REST (/games/:gameId/allIn) endpoints
- **Real-Time Updates**: Immediate UI updates and game state synchronization for all-in actions
- **Side Pot Integration**: Seamless integration with existing comprehensive side pot system

#### Test Infrastructure Fixes ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Fixed Selenium Test Timeouts**: Enhanced timeout handling for game controls verification and browser cleanup
- **Issue**: Test suite was failing on "game controls should be properly disabled" with indefinite hangs
- **Solution**: Added Promise.race timeout protection, improved error handling, aggressive cleanup operations
- **Result**: All 74 test steps now complete successfully without timeouts
- **Files**: selenium/step_definitions/multiplayer-poker-round-steps.js, selenium/step_definitions/hooks.js

## 🔥 **HIGH PRIORITY WORK (Next 1-2 Weeks)**

Based on your `game.md` specification, here are the **remaining critical gaps** that need immediate attention:

- **Automatic Phase Transitions**: Complete automation of preflop→flop→turn→river→showdown transitions
- **WebSocket Broadcasting**: Real-time automatic phase transition events (`automaticFlop`, `automaticTurn`, `automaticRiver`, `automaticShowdown`)
- **Professional Automation**: Proper burn card handling, community card dealing, and showdown logic
- **Callback System**: GameService→GameManager callback architecture for seamless WebSocket integration
- **All-In Automation**: Smart detection when all players are all-in, automatically advancing through all phases
- **Single Player Wins**: Automatic pot awarding when all other players fold
- **Frontend Integration**: Complete WebSocket event handling for automatic transitions with system messages
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 10 detailed test scenarios covering all automatic transition scenarios
- **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed console logging for debugging automatic transitions and betting round completion

**Professional Compliance**: All automatic transitions follow official Texas Hold'em rules with proper phase progression, community card dealing, and pot distribution

### 3. **Enhanced Blind System** ⚠️ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Current Status**: Basic blind posting exists but needs professional enhancements
**Missing**: Dead blind rules, blind increase schedules, late entry blind posting
**Impact**: Tournament and cash game scenarios not fully supported
**Action Required**:
- Implement dead blind rules for seat changes
- Add configurable blind increase schedules
- Create late entry blind posting logic

## 🎯 **MEDIUM PRIORITY WORK (Next 2-4 Weeks)**

### 4. **User Role Management** 
**Current Gap**: Basic player/spectator distinction exists
**Missing**: Moderator roles, admin controls, permission system
**Impact**: Cannot manage tournaments or private games effectively

### 5. **Game Persistence and Reconnection**
**Current Gap**: No persistence across browser refreshes
**Missing**: Session restoration, game state recovery, reconnection logic
**Impact**: Poor user experience during network issues

### 6. **Professional UI/UX Enhancements**
**Current Gap**: Functional but not polished poker room experience
**Missing**: Card animations, chip animations, sound effects, dealer announcements
**Impact**: Less engaging user experience compared to commercial poker sites

## 🌟 **LOWER PRIORITY WORK (Next 4-6 Weeks)**

### 7. **Tournament System**
**Missing**: Tournament brackets, blind schedules, prize distribution
**Impact**: Cannot host structured tournaments

### 8. **Multi-Table Support** 
**Missing**: Table management, player movement, lobby improvements
**Impact**: Cannot scale to casino-style poker room

### 9. **Statistics and Hand History**
**Missing**: Player statistics, hand replays, performance tracking
**Impact**: Recreational players missing progression feedback

## 📊 **SUCCESS METRICS**

### ✅ **ACHIEVED**
- **All-In System**: ✅ Professional all-in implementation completed
- **Side Pot System**: ✅ Complex side pot creation and distribution working
- **Test Coverage**: ✅ Comprehensive test suite with 10+ advanced scenarios
- **API Completeness**: ✅ All poker actions supported (bet, call, raise, fold, check, allIn)
- **Real-Time Updates**: ✅ WebSocket synchronization and UI updates working

- **Automated Phase Transitions**: Betting round completion and phase advancement
- **Enhanced Blind System**: Dead blinds, late entry, tournament schedules
- **Game Persistence**: Session restoration and reconnection logic

## 🚀 **DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES**

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Every new feature must have comprehensive Cucumber tests
2. **Professional Poker Compliance**: All implementations must follow official Texas Hold'em rules
3. **Real-Time First**: All changes must work seamlessly with WebSocket updates
4. **User Experience Focus**: Prioritize smooth, intuitive gameplay over complex features
5. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure sub-100ms response times for all poker actions
6. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of edge cases with clear user feedback
