# Manual Test: Navigation Bug Fix

## Test: Automatic Redirection When Location is Lobby but User is on Game Page

This test verifies that users are automatically redirected from game pages to the lobby when their location state is "lobby".

### Prerequisites
1. Start the development servers: `npm run dev`
2. Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`

### Test Steps

#### Method 1: Using Browser Console
1. Navigate to a game page: `http://localhost:3000/game/1`
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Check current location state:
   ```javascript
   window.socketService.getCurrentUserLocation()
   // Should return "lobby" by default
   ```

4. Since location is already "lobby" but you're on game page, the automatic navigation should trigger
5. You should be automatically redirected to the lobby (`/`)

#### Method 2: Direct Navigation Test  
1. Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Wait for full page load (2-3 seconds)
3. Manually type in URL: `http://localhost:3000/game/1`
4. You should be automatically redirected back to lobby

#### Method 3: User Presence Test (New Test)
This tests the user presence-based redirection that checks if user is in players or observers list.

1. Open browser to `http://localhost:3000` 
2. Set a nickname cookie (if not already set):
   ```javascript
   document.cookie = "playerNickname=TestUser; path=/"
   ```
3. Wait for connection and initial load (2-3 seconds)
4. Manually navigate to a game page: `http://localhost:3000/game/1`
5. **Expected Result**: User should be automatically redirected to lobby because they are not in the players or observers list for that game

#### Method 4: Console Verification
1. After any of the above tests, check console logs for:
   ```
   ðŸš€ REDIRECT: User "TestUser" not found in players or observers list, redirecting to lobby
   ðŸš€ REDIRECT: Current players: []
   ðŸš€ REDIRECT: Current observers: []
   ```

### Expected Behavior
- **Immediate Redirection**: Users should be redirected within 1-2 seconds
- **Console Logging**: Clear log messages explaining why redirection occurred
- **No Manual Intervention**: Process should be completely automatic
- **State Consistency**: User location should be "lobby" after redirection

### Success Criteria
âœ… User cannot stay on game page when location is "lobby"  
âœ… User cannot stay on game page when not in players/observers list  
âœ… Console logs show clear redirection reasoning  
âœ… Redirection happens automatically without user action  
âœ… Users end up on lobby page (`/`)  

### Notes
- The user presence check is more reliable than location-based checking
- This fixes the bug where frontend logs showed location as "lobby" but user could still stay on game page
- The fix activates on any game state update, ensuring consistent enforcement

## Additional Test Cases

### Test: Correct Game Page Navigation
1. Simulate location change to a table:
   ```javascript
   window.socketService.handleLocationUpdate({
     playerId: window.socketService.getSocket().id,
     nickname: 'TestUser',
     location: 'table-5'
   })
   ```
2. Should navigate to `/game/5` if not already there

### Test: No Unnecessary Navigation
1. Go to lobby page
2. Ensure location is "lobby"
3. Should NOT trigger any navigation (already on correct page)

## Bug Fix Summary
- **Issue**: Frontend correctly tracked location as "lobby" but didn't automatically navigate
- **Root Cause**: `handleLocationBasedNavigation` only logged but didn't perform actual navigation
- **Solution**: Created `navigationService` for programmatic navigation from socketService
- **Result**: Automatic redirection now works when location/page mismatch is detected
